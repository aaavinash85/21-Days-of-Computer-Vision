# 21-Days-of-Computer-Vision
Hello Everyone, as we all know that there is a lockdown of 21 days in India due to covid-19.So Me and my friend Arpita Gupta  thought that during this Quarantine period we should create some content to help beginners to start  with computer vision.So this series is called as "21 days of Computer Vision".We would be uploading a video each day except sunday.This video series aims to help beginners and the students who want to get started with computer vision and want a kickstart in the field.So I hope this would be great journey of helping the community out there and utilizing the period of quarentine. Let's start this and Happy Learning :) This is our YouTube channel named *The Caffeine Developers* please support us and Subscribe to our Channel as Everyday we will be Posting videos. https://lnkd.in/fKzEbqt
